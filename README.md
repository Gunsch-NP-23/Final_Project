# CPS FINAL PROJECT & ASSIGNMENTS REPO

## META INFORMATION REGARDING REPO
This repo is for the final project and class assignments. Information learned and practiced in the 
https://github.com/Gunsch-NP-23/web-dev-spring-2023 repo will be applied to assignments and the final project
for CPS493.

## GRAND PRIX EXERCISE APP.
The idea of this project will be a tool to record your running "circuits" and then try to beat yourself and others in "courses" -
(Like running around a park or something.) - in speed or other metrics.
